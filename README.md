# Benchmark speech emotion recognition techniques
Benchmark created to evaluate Speech Emotion Recognition Models

State of the art introduces a series of Deep Learning Models to recognize emotions on speech, and they compare themselves against others using available datasets. However it is hard to make comparasions due of the different metrics used by each paper. 

This work aims to compare in a fair way those models using the same benchamrks for everyone.


## Roadmap:
- [X] Benchmark Class
- [X] Dataset Class
- [X] Ravdess Benchmark
- [ ] Iemocap Benchmark
- [X] CNN 2D Traditional Spectrogram
- [X] CNN 1D 
- [ ] LSTM
- [ ] RNN
- [ ] Web to present benchmarks
